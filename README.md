This exercise is part of a larger undertaking, hence the backbone.js code. 
The nodes are layed out using David Piegza's force-directed-layout. 
Feel free to do with this code as you please.
Credit would be nice though, should you find it useful ;)
This visualization wouldn't be possibile without [threejs.org].
